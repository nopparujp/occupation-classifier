Jobtopgun challenge: Job title classification
Jobtopgun.com is one of the most frequented websites for job application and talent recruitment in Thailand. The Jobtopgun team has over 20 years of experience in the recruitment and human resources industry. Thus, they are domain experts and has applied their own job hierarchy for core products such as job search and job recommendation. Previously, breaking down jobs into their category requires manual inputs from the users (job seekers or talent acquisitors). Job seekers must select both occupations and occupation groups for each job title to be included in their resume. Job recruiters have to select relevant occupations besides filling in the job title for recruitment. As a result, the Jobtopgun team would like to automatically categorize occupations according to their hierarchy in order to improve user experiences.

There are 154 occupation groups and 597 occupations for this task.
